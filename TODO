admin page - to clear db, mainly.

A thought from Aaron that would be nice: how about "export a year of clippings". Ie: 
date-bounded export. Would be nice. (export flat site; export flat site limited by range)

export:
  √ book (method on book controller)
  √ all (method on exports controller)
  √ date range (method on exports controller)
  individual clipping to markup in a lightbox? (method on... clipping?)
    - should there be a little customisable options field with a template?
  fine-tune default fields for clipping#to_xml - should definitely remove id, for instance.

search?
