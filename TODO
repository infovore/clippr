Pictures?

A thought from Aaron that would be nice: how about "export a year of clippings". Ie: 
date-bounded export. Would be nice. (export flat site; export flat site limited by range)
search?

admin page - to clear db, mainly.

Rename Book:

book has_one BookName, which you create on ingest, which prepopulates with the name and also a slug.
you edit the bookname, never the book.

Rename Author:

this is more complex, as many books have to belong to an author. If you edit the name of an author - and you change it to an existing author - we then join it to the appropriate thing. Might be worth seeing how bootstrap does autocomplete? this is basically a many to many join, unlike naming books, so it feels a bit more complicated.
